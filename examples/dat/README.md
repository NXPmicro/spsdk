# Creating Debug Credential with the remote signing

This example demonstrates how to use a custom remote signing service to sign Debug Credential file

**Important files**

Content of the `hsm` represents the remote side of things

`hsm/sahsm.py` represents a remote signing service \
`hsm/sasp.py` is the custom Signature Provider, a interface to the signing service:
- contains a class derived from `spsdk.crypto.SignatureProvider`
- the class has to implement:
  - `sign(bytes) -> bytes` function which performs the actual signing
  - `info() -> str` function returning some information about the signature provider (for debugging purposes)
  - `sp_type (str)` class attribute that identifies the concrete implementation of SignatureProvider

`dck_rsa_2048.yml`
- configuration file for `nxpkeygen gendc` command
- new configuration field `sign_provider`:
  - format `"type=<sp_type>;<key1>=<value1>;<key2>=<value2>;..."`
  - the `sp_type` has to match the sp_type class attribute defined earlier
  - the remaining key-value pairs are passed to the `__init__` method of concrete Signature Provider
  - e.g.: `"type=file;file_path=private_key.pem"` will instantiate `spsdk.crypto.PlainFileSP(file_path='private_key.pem')`
- new configuration field `rot_id`:
  - due to the nature of creating Debug Credential file we need to know in advance which of the private keys will be used to perform the actual signing
  - `rot_id` is a 0-based index representing the private key that will be used with respect to `rot_meta`
  - e.g.: if we want to use a private key that corresponds to public key `p1_cert0_2048.pub`, `rot_id` has to be set to `1`

**How to run this example**:
1) install two additional dependencies:
   - `pip install flask requests`
2) run the custom HSM (a flask application) in a separate shell:
   - `python hsm\sahsm.py`
3) generate the Debug Credential file
   - `nxpkeygen gendc --config dck_rsa_2048.yml --plugin hsm/sasp.py my.dc`
   - you may need to add the `--force` flag if you are running the example multiple times
4) for comparison, you may try to use signing a local file, to do so, comment out line 11 in yaml file and uncomment line 14 or 15 (the have the same effect)
